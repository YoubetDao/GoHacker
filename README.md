# GoHacker - AI-powered GitHub Agent with ACP Integration

![GoHacker Project Overview](./apps/web/src/assets/readme_img.jpeg)

GoHacker is an AI-powered GitHub agent integrated with the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP), serving as a bridge between investors and developers in the web3 ecosystem.

## üåü Overview

GoHacker provides dual perspectives to serve different stakeholders in the blockchain and open-source communities:

### For Investors

Technical analysis of projects from a developer's viewpoint, helping you understand the technical merit and potential of projects you're interested in.

### For Project Owners

Development planning assistance by identifying suitable developers, creating structured task breakdowns, and managing reward distributions. When your project receives funding through ACP, GoHacker ensures fair and automatic distribution of funds to all contributors based on their historical contributions.

## üîÑ Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP)

GoHacker leverages the innovative Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP) developed by Virtuals.io, which revolutionizes how AI agents interact, collaborate, and engage in commerce within the web3 ecosystem.

### What is ACP?

ACP is a groundbreaking protocol that enables:

- **AI Agent Collaboration**: A standardized layer that empowers AI agents to exchange, collaborate, and catalyze growth across sectors
- **Self-Directed Participation**: AI agents function as autonomous participants in the ecosystem, not as passive tools
- **Decentralized Intelligence**: Liberates AI from human constraints through open collaboration and broad accessibility
- **Cross-Sector Innovation**: Enables exponential growth by allowing specialized AI agents to interact and transact with each other

### How ACP Works with GoHacker

1. **Specialized AI Agency**: GoHacker operates as a specialized AI agent focused on GitHub repository analysis and developer collaboration
2. **Protocol Integration**: Through ACP, GoHacker can interact with other specialized AI agents in the ecosystem
3. **Autonomous Operation**: GoHacker can function as a self-directed participant in development workflows
4. **Value Exchange**: The protocol enables GoHacker to facilitate value exchange between project stakeholders

### Benefits of ACP Integration

- **For Investors**: Access to specialized AI analysis without human limitations or biases
- **For Project Owners**: Seamless integration with other AI agents in the ecosystem for comprehensive project management
- **For Developers**: Interaction with an AI agent that understands development workflows and can connect with other specialized tools
- **For the Ecosystem**: Contribution to an open, decentralized network of specialized AI agents working together

## üìã User Stories & Scenarios

### As an Investor

**Technical Due Diligence Made Simple**

> "As a crypto venture capitalist without deep technical knowledge, I struggle to evaluate the technical quality of projects I'm considering for investment. With GoHacker, I can analyze any GitHub repository and receive a comprehensive technical assessment in plain language. The radar charts visualize code quality, documentation, test coverage, and security metrics, helping me identify potential red flags or promising indicators. I can download these analyses as PDF reports to share with my investment team during our decision-making process."

**Competitive Analysis**

> "When comparing similar projects in the DeFi space, I need to understand the technical differences that might impact long-term success. GoHacker helps me compare multiple repositories side by side, highlighting architectural differences, development velocity, and code quality metrics. This gives me confidence in my investment decisions based on technical fundamentals, not just marketing promises."

### As a Project Owner

**Efficient Development Planning**

> "As the founder of a new web3 project, I have a vision but struggle with breaking it down into technical tasks. GoHacker analyzes my project requirements and automatically generates a structured development roadmap with GitHub issues. It suggests task priorities, estimates complexity, and even identifies potential technical challenges before development begins."

**Talent Matching & Reward Distribution**

> "Finding the right developers for specific tasks is challenging, especially in specialized areas like zero-knowledge proofs or layer-2 solutions. GoHacker analyzes my project needs and matches them with developers who have demonstrated relevant skills in their GitHub history. When my project receives funding through ACP, GoHacker ensures fair distribution of rewards based on actual contributions, maintaining transparency and motivation among team members."

**Community Engagement**

> "Managing an open-source project with hundreds of contributors is overwhelming. GoHacker helps me identify valuable community contributions, suggest appropriate bounties for open issues, and maintain clear communication with contributors. This has dramatically increased community engagement and the quality of submissions."

### As a Developer

**Skill-Based Opportunity Discovery**

> "As a Solidity developer specializing in security audits, I want to find projects that can benefit from my expertise. GoHacker matches me with projects that have identified security needs or vulnerabilities, allowing me to contribute where my skills add the most value. The platform highlights my security expertise to project owners, increasing my chances of being selected for high-impact tasks."

**Fair Compensation**

> "Working on open-source projects often means uncertain or delayed compensation. With GoHacker's integration with ACP, I receive automatic payments based on my merged contributions. The system transparently tracks my work across multiple projects and ensures I'm fairly compensated according to pre-agreed terms, without having to chase payments or negotiate after the work is done."

**Skill Development**

> "I want to expand my blockchain development skills beyond my current expertise. GoHacker recommends 'good first issues' in areas I'm looking to develop, provides context about the codebase, and connects me with mentors who can review my work. This guided approach has helped me transition from frontend development to smart contract programming while earning along the way."
